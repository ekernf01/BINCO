## Regression subset selection FDR control from bootstrap selection frequencies

BINCO is a method for controlling FDR by bootstrapping an arbitrary subset selection method. BINCO was created by Shuang Li and coauthors and published in [a 2013 paper](https://doi.org/10.1214/12-AOAS589). The original source code is publicly available at [https://cran.r-project.org/package=BINCO](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BINCO). This is a fork of the original code with one crucial error fixed and with slightly different default settings.
